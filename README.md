# Code Refactor Starter Code


# The first thing I noticed was the div soup, I spent some time replacing some div tags with tags that made the code blocks visablly nocicable


# Second thing was I added comment tags so blocks of the code is easiely located


# The css style sheet needed some consolidation of code. Some of the code wasnt orginized properly top from bottem. I orginized it in a way from top to bottem of the html file. Lasetly with the css style sheet, I added the proper comment tags so its easy to locate areas of the code.



# I also made the the wbsite more acsessible, and optimized for web seartches.





# The thing I stuggled with the most was the footer, I tried multible things to have it in the same place it was originally in. But im also confused about it. Because in the reference photo the footer wasnt in there. So im not sure if i should delet it or keep it in there.



# At first glance I was overwhelmed by the challenge, But with utalizing some recorcefulness. It actually was quit simple, and pretty fun. I honesly learned a lot from this challenge.
